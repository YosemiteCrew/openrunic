// Forbidden-terms gate.
//
// Both repositories are public. Prior art may be studied freely; the source may
// never be NAMED - not in code, comments, tests, fixtures, docs, commit
// messages, branch names, or pull-request text. Until this script existed the
// rule was enforced by a git hook on three laptops, and a hook is a reminder
// rather than a gate: `pnpm install` runs husky's `prepare`, which rewrites
// `core.hooksPath` for the whole clone, and the guard is disarmed until somebody
// notices. That happened seven times in one day and reached a commit once.
//
// WHAT THIS SCRIPT MUST NEVER DO
//
//   * print a match, or any substring of one
//   * print the pattern, decoded or encoded
//   * write either to a file, an output, or a job summary
//
// A guard whose failure output is the list of terms is worse than no guard: the
// run log of a public repository is a published artifact in a way a terminal is
// not. Findings therefore carry a SURFACE, a FILE and a LINE and nothing else.
// That is enough to act on, because the author knows what they wrote.
//
// WHY THE PATTERN IS AN ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE AND NOT A FILE
//
// The pattern is the term list. Committing it to a public repository publishes
// exactly what it exists to withhold, so it arrives as a base64 blob in a
// repository secret and is decoded here. The must-block corpus is a second blob
// for the same reason. The must-PASS corpus is checked in
// (forbidden-terms-allowed-prose.txt) because it names nothing.
//
// ERRORING IS NOT FINDING. Exit 2 means the guard could not run - no pattern, a
// pattern that will not compile, a corpus that came back short, a self-test that
// failed. Exit 1 means it ran and found something. Exit 0 means it ran and did
// not. A caller that treats 2 as clean has reintroduced the failure this whole
// script exists to remove.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/ci/forbidden-terms.mjs selftest --min-corpus <n>
//   node scripts/ci/forbidden-terms.mjs scan --dir <directory>
//
// The directory holds one file per surface, named for it: diff, names,
// messages, branch, title, body. ALL SIX are read and a missing one is exit 2 -
// the caller does not get to choose which surfaces are checked, because a
// caller that can omit one is a caller that will. `diff` expects unified diff
// text and reports the file and line of the ADDED line, which is why it is a
// surface of its own rather than another blob of text.
