// Enforce openrunic's Sonar bar in CI, because SonarCloud will not.
//
// Usage, from the directory that was scanned:
//   node scripts/ci/sonar-thresholds.mjs [--coverage 95] [--duplication 0] [--issues 0]
//
// It takes no path. The scanner writes `.scannerwork/report-task.txt` under the
// directory it scanned, so the caller sets the working directory and this reads
// a constant relative path. That is deliberate rather than incidental: an
// earlier version took `--base-dir`, and a path assembled from an argument and
// then read is a file-inclusion sink whether or not anything hostile can reach
// the argument. Bounding it was not enough - the sink is the shape, not the
// value - so the argument is gone and there is nothing left to bound.
//
// The scan step already passes `sonar.qualitygate.wait=true`, so a red gate reds
// the job. The trouble is which gate it waits for. Attaching a custom quality
// gate to a project needs a plan this organisation does not have - the API
// answers `api/qualitygates/select` with "Organization ... is not allowed to
// modify Quality gates" - so the only verdict available is the built-in "Sonar
// way": 80% coverage and 3% duplication on new code, and no condition on the
// issue count at all. Those are not the numbers this repository claims, and the
// difference is not small.
//
// Two further gaps come with any gate written against new code:
//
//   - A pull request analysis evaluates NEW-code conditions only, and drops even
//     those when the pull request introduces no new lines. A change can pass a
//     green gate while the project sits well below the bar.
//   - "Sonar way" carries no issue condition, so a project accumulating smells
//     passes it indefinitely as long as each individual change is clean. That is
//     exactly the drift `docs/quality-gates.md` says a gate is meant to stop.
//
// So this reads the measures the analysis just published and holds them to the
// bar docs/quality-gates.md states. What those measures mean depends on the
// analysis scope, verified against live analyses rather than assumed:
//
//   - A branch (main) analysis publishes whole-branch figures for all three
//     metrics: is this project at 95% coverage, zero duplication and zero open
//     issues right now.
//   - A pull request analysis publishes whole-project `coverage` and
//     `duplicated_lines_density` as of the PR head, but its `violations` counts
//     the issues open on the PR itself. A PR leg therefore enforces "the whole
//     project meets the coverage and duplication bar, and this change
//     introduces zero issues"; the push-to-main scan enforces zero open issues
//     across the whole branch.
//
// Dependency-free by design, like the other scripts in this directory: the scan
// job deliberately does not install the workspace, so this has only Node to
// work with.
